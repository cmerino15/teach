# Opening the CMD (Command Prompt)

You can use the following keyboard shortcut from anywhere to open the command prompt in your root directory. Usually `C:\Users\username`

> wndw+r // to bring up the run prompt
> enter

> [!NOTE]
> If you have opened another program with the run prompt, this keyboard shortcut may just open that program again. In that case, make sure you type `cmd` into the prompt before you hit enter.

Alternatively, you can open the CMD in any other directory by clicking on the address field of that directory and typing `cmd` then hitting enter.

To see some basic commands you can use the help command. This will display a list of commands that are available. Don't worry if it's a little overwhelming at first.

```console
help
```

To see some more info on some of the commands listed use `/?` 
For example

```console
dir /?
```

One of the listed commands that is outputted from dir /? is /B which gives the dir command in bareformat. So we can try that

```console
dir /B
```

To clear the screen 

```console
cls
```

Some of the most useful commands are for navigating

To see what files are in the current directory 

```console
dir
```

To exit the CMD
```console
exit
```

For the rest of this tutorial we will work in a test directory that we make ourselves. For now just exit the CMD and move on to the next section.
