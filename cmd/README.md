# Powershell vs CMD vs WSL  and Windows Terminal

For the longest time cmd was shell used by windows. Lately, powershell was realesed which included a few more options that developers wanted. 
For the most part, I could make due with just CMD for my purposes. 
Every once in a while I needed to work in a linux system and so I had to learn WSL. 

Fast forward to now...

Microsoft realease Windows Terminal. A very useful application that allows the easy use and management of all three of the above and other shells.

In my tutorial I'll start with a basic CMD tutorial. The reason is becaus a lot of documentation and tutorials online have commands that use CMD. 

I'll then move on to Powershell so that you get acquanted with that Shell. 

Finally, I'll do everything from the windows terminal so that you have the option to use whatever shell you want. Hopefully, by this point, you'll feel comfortable
using any shell withing Windows Terminal.
