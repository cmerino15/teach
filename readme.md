## Python Resources

- [Future Coder](https://futurecoder.io/) - Basics of shell and python - good for a brand new coder

- [Examples of Python Graphs](https://python-charts.com/)
- [More Examples of Python Graphs](https://python-graph-gallery.com/)

## WebDev Resources - The following three links are, in my opinion, the best way to start

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) 
- [MDN DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) 

## Git

- [Contributing Tutorial - try this before the following two links](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions?tab=readme-ov-file)
- [First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/)
- [First Issues - 2](https://goodfirstissue.dev/language/cplusplus)

# Other Tutorials Sites - In my opinion, these are not needed since there are some many other helpful sites/youtube/documentation/forums/google etc.
  
- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Like udemy but tailored for programming
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) - More than programming courses - some paid
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) - Paid
