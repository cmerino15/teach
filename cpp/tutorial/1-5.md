# Functions

We can write functions to save ourselves the time of rewriting code that we will often use. 
For example, say you want to create a username for a user based on their favorite number and name. 
If you only had one use the code could be written as follows. 

> main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
  std::string fname, lname, favnum;
  std::cout << "Enter your first and last name\n";
  std::cin >> fname >> lname;
  std::cout << "Thanks, " << fname << ". Now enter you favorite number\n";
  std::cin >> favnum;
  std::string uname = fname.at(0) + lname + favnum;  // std::string has an .at() function that lets us access the nth character of the string, by entering n-1.
  std::cout << "Thank you. Your username is " << uname;
}
```

Try running this code on your own and try different values for the 'at' function, to get the hang of it. 
This is great and all, but if we wanted to let the user create 100 usernames (using a file, for example), then we could really benefit in using a function.
We'll see how to read in data from files later. 

In C++, we have two basic types of functions. Void functions that don't return values and Value Returning functions that return a value. First, we'll focus on a void function so that we can easily copy our old code and paste it in our function. I'll also show you how we could write this program with a value returning function further below.

In C++, we split a function into it's declaration and definition. The declaration usually goes before the main function and the definition afterward. Here's how the function would look like for our example. 

> main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void createUName(); // all this does is it tells the compiler what the functions return type is (void) and its parameters (none)

int main(){
  createUName();   // the program jumps to our function definition and runs that code once
  createUName();   // the program jumps to our function definition and runs that code again
  createUName();   // and again ... great! we didn't have to type all that code out again 
}

// here is where we actually define what our function will actually do everytime it's called
void createUname(){
  std::string fname, lname, favnum;
  std::cout << "Enter your first and last name\n";
  std::cin >> fname >> lname;
  std::cout << "Thanks, " << fname << ". Now enter you favorite number\n";
  std::cin >> favnum;
  std::string uname = fname.at(0) + lname + favnum;
  std::cout << "Thank you. Your username is " << uname;
}
```

And now using a value (string) returning function. 

> main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>

std::string createUName(); // all this does is it tells the compiler what the functions return type is (void) and its parameters (none)

int main(){

  
  std::cout << "Thank you. Your username is " << createUName();   // the program jumps to our function definition and runs that code once
  std::cout << "Thank you. Your username is " << createUName();    // the program jumps to our function definition and runs that code again
  std::cout << "Thank you. Your username is " << createUName();    // and again ... great! we didn't have to type all that code out again 
}

// here is where we actually define what our function will actually do everytime it's called
st::string createUname(){
  std::string fname, lname, favnum;
  std::cout << "Enter your first and last name\n";
  std::cin >> fname >> lname;
  std::cout << "Thanks, " << fname << ". Now enter you favorite number\n";
  std::cin >> favnum;
  std::string uname = fname.at(0) + lname + favnum;
  return uname;  // instead of using std::cout we return the string to the main program
  
}
```
