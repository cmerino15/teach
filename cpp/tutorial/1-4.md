# If/Else-If Conditional Statements, the While Loop, and the Basic For Loop

We can use if and else-if statements to write conditional code. 
For example, say we wanted to ask the user to choose their honorific (either mr and mrs to keep it simple for now).
Then, we want to cout a greeting. We can do this with an if and else-if statement. 

> [!NOTE]
> We only need one if statement and we can nest as many else if as we want. Furthermore, we can end with an optional else statement.

> Ex: main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
  int x = 0;
  std::cout <<"Enter 1 if you prefer Mr. and 3 if you prefer Mrs.\n";
  std::cin >> x;  // awaits for user to enter any integer
  if(x == 1){  // notice the use of double equals.  x == 1 may evaluate to 'true' or 1 OR it may evaluate to 'false' or 0
    std::cout <<"Welcome, Mr. " << std::endl; // you can add more code as you please
  } else if ( x == 3){ 
    std::cout <<"Welcome, Mrs. " << std::endl;
  }
  // the following code is optional ... but an else statement musta always follow an if statement
  else {   // notice their is nothing to evaluate...this handles all other cases or integers entered
    std::cout <<"You didn't enter a valid answer (1 or 3) \n";
  }
}
```

> output

```console
  Enter 1 if you prefer Mr. and 3 if you prefer Mrs.
  <your input...assume you enter 3>
  Welcome, Mrs. 
```
