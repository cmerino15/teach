# Basic output, data types, and operations

In c++ we have to **declare** our variables for the data we would like to use. 
We'll be working with 3 `data types` for now. 

<details>
<summary> data types </summary>

1. int: integers 
2. string: strings 
3. double: decimal values

</details>

We can do basic math operations on ints and doubles. Some care must be taking when using the divison / and modulo % operations however.

> Example: main.cpp

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// note: some compilers include string in iostream. I suggest always including the line that's commented-out below
// #include <string>

int main(){
   int x = 5; // the integer, x, is declared to be an int and assigned the value 5. 
              // declaring and assigment is known as initializing

   // the equals symbol is used to assign values after operations
   x = x + 2;  // from right to left, two is added to x and THEN the new value is assigned to x
   std::string name; // the string, name, is declared. 
   name = "John"; // and assigned the value John 

   std::cout << "Hi, " << name << std::endl; // we can ouput different data by separating each thing with <<
   // notice the comma AND the space after hi. endl makes a new line and comes from the standard namespace
   std::cout << "the integer in x is " << 10*x << std::endl; // multiply x by 10, remember that x now holds the value 7

}
```

> output
```console
   Hi, John
   the integer in x is 70
```
