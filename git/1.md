# Basic Workflow for a local directory with Python files

## Make a new directory and create some basic files

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the IDE of your choice to work with python files, but I'll just be using notepad to keep things IDE independent

Create a directory to work in and start notepad with a python file.
> CMD
```console
mkdir testdir
start notepad main.py
```
Let's just include a basic 'hello' message. 
> main.py
```python
print('hello world')
```

Thus far, we just have one file in our test directory. We haven't iniated git nor created a virtual environment. 
We don't need to create a virtual environment but, since this is very helpful, I'll be creating one. Feel free to skip this step.

> CMD
```console
python -m venv testvenv
```
